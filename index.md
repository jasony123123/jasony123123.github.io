Texas State University – Research Assistant, Math Department Jun 2018 - Aug 2019
• Built a pipeline in Mathematica to convert protein data into a 3D mesh and a point cloud with 300,000+ data points.
• Implemented topological data analysis algorithms with MATLAB and JavaPlex to detect holes, tunnels, and cavities in the protein -
features critical to biology and cancer research.
• Used data filtering techniques to extract key points in the dataset, speeding up the detection algorithm 3x.
• Coauthored paper and published in a conference (see here).

Currency Arbitrage Bot – Detects cycles in forex rates that exhibit pricing inefficiencies Aug 2020 - Present
• Built a modified bellman-ford algorithm in C++ to detect negative cycles, corresponding to currency cycles that are mispriced and
present a temporary arbitrage opportunity. Added a greedy algorithm to find the most profitable such arbitrage opportunity.
• Used Python to get real-time quotes via a REST API. Linked Python program to the C++ program by using the subprocess library
and GNU make. Cached quotes using pickle, the Python library, to boost speed
